## rcppkalman

Kalman filtering via RcppArmadillo -- based on a port of the 
[EKF/UKF](http://becs.aalto.fi/en/research/bayes/ekfukf/) toolbox for Matlab

### Status

Highly incomplete.  

We currently support the basic demo for a basic Kalman filter using
prediction, update and smoother.

Additional function should get added over time.

### Author

The [EKF/UKF Toolbox for Matlab](http://becs.aalto.fi/en/research/bayes/ekfukf) 
was written by Simo Särkkä, Jouni Hartikainen, and Arno Solin.
